Hello guys, 

If any of you are here, welcome!

I am not a professional of python, just someone who is trying to learn as much as possible by doing it. I have some experiences but i am trying to help (if possible) people that are struggling to code. 
I am here to provide examples, or ways to prepare for "finance coding" so the topics will be around librairies such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, and many else...

Please, DO correct me if any mistakes. We are here to help and build a strong relationship with each other and learn how to do projects at the very end. 

I do not provide basics, therefore there are would be not a step by step guide but i could provide a list of how to use things in the near future. 

Thanks!
